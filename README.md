# Unnamed project

Make news content relevant to readers by integrating with their digital social network.

Starting with geography, then moving to companies. and eventually other areas, do natural language processing of news articles while users are reading. If a city/state/county name comes up, the readers social network is cross referenced for people who are/were in those places.
